## Design

### API Keys page

The API keys page is located within the Settings area of the left nav above User management.

The page title is "API keys" wiht a description of "Browse endpoints for available models and MCP servers."

The page includes a primary action button of "Create API key" and then a table showing all API keys. The table has columns for Name, API Key (e.g. sk-1234...), Assets (e.g. model names), and Owner (e.g. User, Service Account, Group).

Clicking "Create API key" reveals a modal with a form inside it to create a new API key. The form has fields for:
* Name (required)
* Description (freeform text box to "Describe the key's purpose)
* Owner (dropdown for User/Group/Service Account, and a dropdown to the right of it to select an actual username/group name/service account name)

It also includes a collapsible section (collapsed by default) for "Limits and Policies. When expanded this section has options to set:
* Token rate limit (tokens per minute)
* Request rate limit (requests per minute)
* Budget limit
* Expiration date

The last section of the modal for "AI Asset Access" provides a few multi-select dropdowns to let users select from lists of:
* Model Endpoints
* MCP Servers & tools
* Vector Databaes
* Agents

### API Key Details page

The API key details page has the name of the key at the top and a partially-hidden key that's copyable below it.

The page has five tabs:
* Details
* Assets
* Metrics
* Policies
* Settings

#### Details tab

The Details tab has a Description List that includes the key's:
* Name
* Description
* API key (partially-hidden and copyable)
* Date created
* Date last used

#### Assets tab

The Assets tab includes collapsible sections for the AI Assets that the API key enables access to. Each section has a table showing the assets of that type that are available:
* Models (with columns for Name, ID, and Endpoint)
* MCP Servers & tools (with columns for Name, Tools, and Endpoint)
* Vector Databases (with columns for Name and Size)
* Agents (with columns for Name and Endpoint)

For the models list, include examples like gpt-oss-20b and grante-3.1b.

For the MCP servers list, include examples like OpenShift, RHEL, Ansible.

#### Metrics tab

The Metrics tab includes various metrics and charts that help the API key owner better understand how the key is being used.

The top of the tab includes a controls area with a dropdown for "Time range" (e.g. 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days) and a link to "View Perses Dashboard"

Below those controls are cards (in a flexbox row) for:
* Total Requests
* Success rate (e.g. 98.2%)
* Total Tokens
* Total Cost

Below these cards is a fulldwidth card with a graph showing the "Total Requests."

### Policies

This tab includes all policies, limits, controls, and constraints that are imposed on the API key.

It includes a table with the Names, IDs, and Descriptions of policies that have been applied by the Platform team. Policy IDs should be all lowercase with dashes for spaces like "devs-rate-limit-standard" and "devs-budget-standard."

### Settings

This tab includes a "Danger Zone" card with a red action button to permanently delete the API key. If a user clicks the delete button a modal should appear to confirm that they want to delete the key, with a text field to type in the key's name manually and then "Confirm" to delete the key.
