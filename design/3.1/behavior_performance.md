# Behavior & Performance Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the behavior and performance considerations for AI model development and deployment workflows.

## Purpose
- Document behavior patterns in AI workflows
- Define performance requirements and monitoring
- Track implementation details for model lifecycle
